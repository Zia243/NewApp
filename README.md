# **NestJS Project**

This is a **NestJS** application designed with modules like authentication, task management, and project management. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running the project locally.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest or stable recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud-based)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (for caching, optional)

---

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it with the following variables:

   ```env
   # Application
 
   # JWT Secret
   JWT_SECRET=your-strong-secret

   # MongoDB Configuration
   #example
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/nestjs_project

   # Redis Configuration
   REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
   REDIS_PORT=6379
 

   # Other configurations as needed
   ```

---

## **Running the Application**

1. **Start MongoDB**:
   Ensure your MongoDB service is running locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB provider like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

2. **Start Redis** (if using caching):
   Start the Redis server using:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn start:dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   The application will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

---

## **Testing**

Run unit and integration tests using:
```bash
npm run test
```

---

## **Common Issues**

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running and the `MONGO_URI` in `.env` is correct.

2. **Redis Connection Error**:
   - Ensure Redis is running and the Redis host/port matches the `.env` configuration.

3. **Environment Variables Not Found**:
   - Check if the `.env` file exists in the root directory and is properly configured.
